            <h1>Grace Bay</h1>
            <img src="gracebay.jpg" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" alt="">
            <p>Hands down, this is one of the prettiest beaches I have ever seen. Grace beach sand is white as snow, it has crystal clear blue water that matches the sky and some amazing seashells to admire. It is a great beach to lie out on and do nothing but read a book. This is not an adventurous spot, so if lying on the beach is not your thing then this isn’t the spot for you. However, if you can just relax and enjoy its pure beauty, it is the perfect spot.</p>

            <h1>Key West</h1>
            <img src="keywest.jpg" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" alt="">
            <p>If you are not wanting to take a long flight or leave the USA, but still want to head to the warmest place possible, you will want to head to Key West. Although it is still in the USA, you will feel like you left the States. It was where Hemingway liked to call home. You are even able to visit his old house and see the seven toed cats that now roam this beach town. Key West is a great spot to enjoy the laid back lifestyle while still having plenty of bars to explore while you are there. It is known for its great nightlife, but also has plenty of partying going on during the day. There is never a dull moment in Key West.</p>
