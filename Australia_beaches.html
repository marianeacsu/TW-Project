            <h1>Cable Beach</h1>
            <img src="cable.jpg" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" alt="">
            <p>Cable Beach is world-renowned for its looooong stretch of sand (14 miles in total) and bathwater tub-style ocean temperatures. Sheer bliss. The beach is also synonymous with camels (the animals were first imported by the European settlers of Australia), and sunset rides are a highlight for many visitors.</p>

            <h1>Four Mile Beach</h1>
            <img src="fourmile.jpg" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" alt="">
            <p>This broad stretch of squeaky sand wraps around the eastern side of the peninsula in a near-perfect arc of sand and swaying palms â€“ access is off the eastern end of Macrossan St, the town's main thoroughfare, and various points south. There's a patrolled swimming area in front of the surf life-saving club (with a stinger net in summer) and sunloungers available for hire.</p>

            <h1>Whitehaven Beach</h1>
            <img src="whitehaven.jpg" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" alt="">
            <p>Whitehaven Beach in the Whitsunday Islands along the Great Barrier Reef is not just one of Australia's top stretches of coast, it often scores a place on lists of the best beaches in the world. The seven-kilometer arc of powdery white sand here is actually silica, a silky-soft substance that creates a striking contrast with the tropical turquoise sea and emerald headlands. Best of all, the beach lies in a national park on Whitsunday Island, ensuring that it remains protected and pristine, despite the many day-trippers who land on these shores.</p>
