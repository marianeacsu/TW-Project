            <h1>San Andrés Beach</h1>
            <img src="sanandres.jpg" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" alt="">
            <p>Barely a speck in the Caribbean Sea off the Nicaraguan coast and once a lair for British pirates, Colombia’s reef-fringed San Andrés is the resort island of choice for holidaying and weekending locals. With barely room for an airport it can get uncomfortably crowded in the high season between December and March. But come on weekdays between May and September before the rains, and the white sands and fish-busy reefs are tranquil.</p>

            <h1>Boa Viagem Beach</h1>
            <img src="brazil.jpg" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" alt="">
            <p>With pricey tickets and even pricier high-season hotels, Rio carnival can be a budget-breaker. But the festival is just as big and brash in Recife in the northeast, where the parades are all for free and plush rooms on the beach in Boa Viagem cost as much as a B&B in tourist-packed carnival Rio. The beach itself is long and broad and the party continues all night in the bars that fill the streets behind.</p>

            <h1>Anakena Beach</h1>
            <img src="chile.jpg" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" alt="">
            <p>Totally on its own, thousands of miles out in the Pacific, Chile’s Easter Island is more famous for its moai standing stone heads than its sandy shores. But this is not only a place for anthropologists and the intrepid outward-bound brigade. Bring a bikini and you’ll look every inch the part on stunning Anakena Beach, with its blinding white sands. Mornings are the best time to head on down as you will have it almost entirely to yourself while most visitors tour those historic statues.</p>
